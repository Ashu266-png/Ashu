            <h1>My Love, My Everything,</h1>
            <p>
              I’ve been thinking about something, and my heart feels heavy knowing I didn’t do what I should have. It’s our mid-anniversary, a beautiful halfway mark of the love story we started on April 7, 2022, and I let it pass without telling you how much you mean to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              How could I miss a chance to celebrate <strong>us</strong>? Every day with you is a gift, every moment a treasure, and yet, I let this special day slip by without showing you the love and admiration you deserve. For that, I am truly sorry.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are the light in my life, the rhythm to my heartbeat, and the dream I never want to wake from. Celebrating these milestones, no matter how big or small, is my way of reminding you that you’re my everything—my greatest blessing.
            </p>
            <p>
              So today, let me say it from the depths of my heart: <strong>Happy mid-anniversary, my love.</strong> Thank you for being my rock, my happiness, and the love of my life. Thank you for every laugh, every hug, and every stolen moment that makes this journey so incredibly beautiful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I promise to never miss another chance to make you feel cherished, adored, and celebrated. I’ll love you with every beat of my heart, today, tomorrow, and forever. Let’s make every day a celebration of the love we share.
            </p>
            <h2>Forever yours,</h2>
